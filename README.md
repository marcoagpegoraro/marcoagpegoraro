## Hi there 👋
### Welcome to my GitHub profile 🐱

My name is Marco, I'm a software developer, I love my cats and I'm a car enthusiast.

I don't have a favorite programming language, each one of them has they own advantages, but if i would need to choose a programming language to program a software in a cold rainy Saturday night, i would probably choose Go.

Feel free to send me an email sometime to talk about anything.
